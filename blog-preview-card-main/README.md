# Practicing Implementation with Frontend Mentor Lab

## Description
In this lab final webpage designs are provided in Figma files, which are then implemented by editing templated local repositories.

## Running the program
To use either webpage, open index.html in a web browser. Adjust screen size to <600 pixels to view mobile design. Hover links to view color change.

## Reflection Questions
> How did using Figma designs as references affect your coding process?

The styling provided allowed for a quick color/font selection and implementation. The dimensions provided allowed for a very clear sketch on paper before even reaching coding.

> What challenges did you encounter when aligning your code with the design specifications?

At the start I was unsure how to structure all of the boxes within each other, which led to a need to make new, larger boxes later.
<br>

> How can the feedback and community resources on Frontend Mentor help you improve as a developer?

Feedback provides a new perspective, and community resources are a source of inspiration and learning opportunity.
