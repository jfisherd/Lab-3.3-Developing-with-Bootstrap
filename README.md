# Lab 3.3, Developing with Bootstrap

## Description
In this lab, webpages from a previous lab are refactored to be styled using more Bootstrap and less custom css.

## Running the program
To use either webpage, open index.html in a web browser. Reduce screen width to view mobile changes for "blog preview"; "qr code component" does not feature any changes in the mobile design, as expected from the Figma design. Hover links on "blog preview" to observe color change.

## Reflection Questions
> What challenges did you face when refactoring your code to use Bootstrap?

Refactoring with Bootstrap required restructuring the html document, which required design references to keep consistent.

> How did using Bootstrap utility classes and components simplify your styling process?


It did not.

Utilities
background color
<br>
Components
card
<br>

> In what scenarios might you choose not to use Bootstrap and write custom CSS instead?

Custom CSS is preferable when a detail, such as size or color, is not already mapped in Bootstrap (e.g. font-size 15px; and color: #68778D cannot be specified using Bootstrap).

font size
color
width
line height
